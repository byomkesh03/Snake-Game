## Description
Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake and tries to eat as much food as possible without hitting the walls or its own body. This version of the game is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started
To run the Snake Game locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git

2. Open the 'index.html' file in your preferred web browser.


## Usage
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake: up, down, left, and right.
Try to eat the food (represented by red dots) to grow longer.
Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body, as it will result in game over.
The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
After game over, you can restart the game by refreshing the page.


## Customization
Feel free to customize the game according to your preferences. Here are a few suggestions:

Adjust the speed of the snake by changing the update interval in the JavaScript code.
Modify the size and appearance of the snake and food by updating the CSS styles.
Add additional features like power-ups or obstacles to make the game more challenging.
